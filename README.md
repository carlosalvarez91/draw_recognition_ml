# Drawings, characters and digits recognition.

Welcome to my machine learning project on drawing, digits and characters recognition! In this project, I have combined three separate datasets to create a hybrid recognition system. The first dataset (Quick Draw) focuses on recognizing hand-drawn sketches, the second dataset (MNIST) focuses on recognizing written digits and the third dataset (Kaggle) focuses on recognizing written characters. By merging these three datasets, we have created a system that can accurately recognize drawings, digits and characters. Please read on for more information about this approach and results.
